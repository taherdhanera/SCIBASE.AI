# Citation Context-Fit Assistant

Self-contained AI-Assisted Research Tools slice for
`SCIBASE-AI/SCIBASE.AI#13`.

The assistant validates citation recommendations before one-click insertion. It
checks whether each candidate supports, contradicts, only contextualizes, or is
irrelevant to the highlighted manuscript claim. It also checks citation intent
labels, evidence strength, field fit, stale evidence, and whether contradictory
citations include an explicit contrast note.

This is intentionally separate from broad AI tool suites, evidence-grounded
summarizers, citation provenance, citation metadata integrity, citation style
normalization, citation diversity, citation retraction watch, methods
reproducibility, figure/table evidence, protocol deviation, novelty overlap,
manuscript similarity, ethics/data availability, statistical consistency, study
power, unit consistency, supplementary readiness, and biomethods provenance
slices.

insertion systems.
