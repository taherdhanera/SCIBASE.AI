# Reviewer Workload Equity Guard

Self-contained Community & User Reputation System slice for
`SCIBASE-AI/SCIBASE.AI#15`.

The guard evaluates pending peer-review assignments before they affect profile
reputation, badges, leaderboards, or project timelines. It checks reviewer
capacity, weekly review hours, opt-outs, leave windows, rest periods, expertise
match, early-career penalty risk, and recent review-credit concentration.

This is intentionally separate from broad reputation ledgers, endorsement rings,
leaderboard eligibility, review civility, review timeliness scoring, recusal/COI,
calibration benches, edit-history integrity, identity-leak checks, appeals,
mentorship, correction-impact, credit attestation, profile visibility, and
template-rubric validation. Its job is to stop unfair negative reputation deltas
when the reviewer was overloaded, unavailable, or mismatched before scoring.

## Run

```bash
npm run check
npm test
npm run demo
npm run demo:video
```

## Outputs

- `reports/summary.json`
- `reports/reviewer-packet.md`
- `reports/summary.svg`
- `reports/demo.webm`

All data is synthetic. The module does not call identity services, profile
systems, leaderboards, email systems, review assignment systems, or external
APIs.
